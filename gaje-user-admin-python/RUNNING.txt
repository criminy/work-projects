## Running Requirements

 * Django 1.3 or above
 * python-ldap 
 * Other supported libraries, depending on specific database needs. 

efregistration requires:

	* An ActiveDirectory server, for authentication within an existing network.
	* An OpenLDAP server, for persisting new attorney information.
	* A django-supported SQL server (mysql,postgresql,oracle), with three databases:
		* A database for the efadmin.
		* A database for the testing/qa system.
		* A database for the production system.

## Configuring 

To run efadmin, you must create and configure the file located in conf/local.py.
There is an example inside of conf/local-example.py

Example:

	$ cp conf/local-example.py conf/local.py
        $ vi conf/local.py

## Running

You can test by running:

	$ ./manage.py runserver

Or by pointing your WSGI-supported webserver (apache2, etc) to django.wsgi .

You can also run using cherrypy, by running:
	
	$ python ./scripts/cherrypy_run.py

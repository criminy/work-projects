Put sitemesh.jar in your container's classpath (tomcat, jboss,activemq, etc)
You could put it into each webapp's WEB-INF/lib, but it looks like there's problems with that.

Create and deploy a webapp that contains the common decorator.

In each webapp's decorators.xml, add a "webapp" attribute to point to the webapp you deployed in Step 2.


<decorators>
    <!-- load decorator from a different web-app deployed in the server -->
    <decorator name="main" webapp="some-other-webapp" 
        page="/decorators/main.jsp">
        <pattern>/*</pattern>
    </decorator>
</decorators>

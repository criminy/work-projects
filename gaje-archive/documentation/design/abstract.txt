The EFiling JMS system is a system based around the JMS provider ActiveMQ. It uses
JMS to create a verb-based business module. 

Each user interface module knows about the verbs 'send' and 'reject'. 
The efiling kernel receives these send and reject calls from the UI using
the JMS provider and translates them to the proper meaning, using
the CaseRecord attached to the given verb.

This is a design where:

 * each module can act and change independently of one another without
   fear of cascading the consequences of bugs and design changes.

 * an arbitrary number of new or duplicate modules can be added without effecting design,
   system performance, or existing business processes.

 * A central kernel is responsible for most of the business logic, which takes the form
   routing code.

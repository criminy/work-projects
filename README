some work projects mirrored here.

for ease and to save space, I stripped all the SVN info out.

gaje-user-admin-python - multi-db user administration system
                         for registering new users.

gaje-ws* - SOAP webservice projects for outside entities
           to interact with our system.

gaje-archive - archival system which analyzes document 
               metadata, then archives to external storage
               locations when the document is a specific age.
               Built in JMS, ActiveMQ, and camel.


elderlaw - application for scheduling attornies to work with
	   pro-bono cases for the elderly. I didn't code
	   this fully but I worked closely with an intern
           on developing this project to teach modern
           java development to them.
